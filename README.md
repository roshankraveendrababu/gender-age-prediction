# Multi Threaded movie booking system

This project is a comprehensive, multi-threaded movie ticket booking system designed to run as an interactive command-line application. It simulates a real-world booking environment where multiple users can browse movies and book seats concurrently. To ensure data integrity under high contention, the system employs an advanced **ReentrantReadWriteLock**  mechanism, allowing for simultaneous read operations while guaranteeing exclusive access for write operations like booking.

A key feature is the autonomous background service, built with ScheduledExecutorService, that automatically handles abandoned bookings by releasing expired seat locks. The system's architecture is built on sound object-oriented principles, showcasing the *Factory pattern* for creating different payment strategies and the *Observer pattern* to decouple post-booking actions, such as sending notifications or updating analytics. This project serves as a practical demonstration of robust backend engineering concepts, including advanced concurrency, system design, and common design patterns.


## Features

- **Advanced Concurrency Control**: Employs a ReentrantReadWriteLock to manage simultaneous booking requests. This allows for high-performance, non-blocking reads (multiple users viewing seats) while ensuring thread-safe, exclusive writes (a single user completing a booking).

- **Autonomous Lock Cleanup**: Utilizes a *ScheduledExecutorService* to run a background task that automatically detects and releases seat locks from abandoned user sessions after a timeout, ensuring seats are returned to the available pool.
- **SOLID Design Patterns**: Implements key patterns for a decoupled and extensible architecture:

    ***Factory Pattern*** to dynamically create different *PaymentStrategy* objects (e.g., UPI, Debit Card).

    ***Observer Pattern*** to notify other components (like an email or analytics service) of successful bookings without coupling them to the BookingService.

    ***Strategy Pattern*** to allow various payment methods to be used interchangeably.


- **Layered Architecture**: Built with a clear separation of concerns, dividing the application into distinct layers (Controllers, Services, Core Entities). This improves maintainability, testability, and makes the codebase easier to navigate and debug.
